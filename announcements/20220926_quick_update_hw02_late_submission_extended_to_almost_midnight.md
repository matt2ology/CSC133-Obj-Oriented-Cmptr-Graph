I've extended the late turn-in on HW2 to 11:59pm tonight. I did this for a couple of you with Comcast at home and, to be fair, Comcast has been a regionwide pill all day long. Most students have submitted and so I don't see this as a large scale problem. I normally won't do this and, going forward, I am going to require in-progress submissions for all long assignments.Â
