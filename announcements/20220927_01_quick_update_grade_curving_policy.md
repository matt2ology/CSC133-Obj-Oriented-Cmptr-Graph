As per the syllabus, whenever I change the syllabus after the first week then I will inform you of this via an announcement. The change is not really a change so much as it is the policy that we discussed in class on the first day regarding curving for the course. As discussed, only the final grades are curved and your ranking in the course will be reported to you after the midterm.Â
