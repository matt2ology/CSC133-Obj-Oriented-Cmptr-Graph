**Syllabus**

I have posted a working copy of the syllabus. Since it is in the process of being updated, there will probably be a number of changes made over the weekend. Please note the syllabus change policy if you have questions about how the syllabus will be changed.  In any case, it should give you a basic flavor of my expectations in this course.

**JavaFX/Java Installation**

I've posted a brief guide to Java/JavaFX installation. Let me know if you have any questions. If you want to be on track, you should have this installed this week. 

**Homework 1**

I will post assignment one tomorrow and it will be due a week from Monday on September 12th. It will involve reworking the SimplePaint program from Chapter 6 in your book. I'm telling you this now for those of  you who like to orient yourselves to the material early. 

**Office Hours**

Office hours are via zoom and will be on Wednesdays from 5:30pm to 7:00pm.
