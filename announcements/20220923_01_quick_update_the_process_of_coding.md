I'm busy today so I may not have time to post the video I was talking about yesterday. However, I think that it's important that you realize that yesterday's lecture was about a process. If you are thinking that what you need is the code then you missed the point. What you need is the process of working on a small feature at a time, testing constantly, and fixing compiler errors as you go. Additionally, you want to make deliberate changes to the class hierarchy.  Thinking in this way will engage you with the material. 

Don't hesitate to send me a Canvas message if you have a specific question.
