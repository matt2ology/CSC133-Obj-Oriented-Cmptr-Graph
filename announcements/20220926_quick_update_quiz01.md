Quiz 1 will be this week. It won't be on Tuesday for those asking. It will either be at the start of Thursday's lecture or it will be remote. I'll decide soon enough. In any case, for those of you stressing, please try to relax. It will be exclusively on Chapter 5 in Java 9 Notes and it will last about 15 minutes. All questions will be multiple choice.Â
