**Homework 2**

Homework 2 has been posted. I cannot emphasize enough that you need to start this project early. I would even recommend that you read over the somewhat long prompt today so that you can bring questions to tonight's lecture. The programs will ramp up in complexity as we go through the course and you will find that rethinking and refactoring will become ever more important with each new assignment. 

There is extra credit for this assignment and it's related to getting started early. The more engaged you are with the assignment, the more opportunity there is for extra credit. 

**Reading For Week's 3/4**

There is new reading for the next two weeks. I will try to get those posted before lecture today. At minimum, to get started you need to continue reading in chapter 6 of the JN9 text. However, there will be a more precise and detailed reading assignment posted later. 

**Office Hours**

As usual, office hours are on Wednesday of this week and next week during the normal class time. This will give you two opportunities to bring your thoughtful questions about HW2 to office hours. I'm expecting a packed office hours the next two weeks so make sure that you really prepare your questions to get the most out of it.
