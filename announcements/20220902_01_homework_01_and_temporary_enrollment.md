## Quick Update :: Homework 1 and Temporary Enrollment

All Sections

**Homework 1**

Homework 1 has been posted. Now, as I mentioned, this is new course content this semester. This means, without fail, that there will be bugs, typos, and changes. If you can't handle this, then this might not be the semester to take this course from me. I will do my best to make sure that these changes impact you minimally, however, you are expected to keep up with any changes to the prompt. I will generally let you know by announcement if there are changes. For this first assignment, there won't be much as it is fairly straightforward. I will post a short video demonstrating the use of the modified paint program over the weekend. 

**Temporary** **Enrollment**

Some of you have been added to Canvas even though you are not enrolled in the course. This is temporary and I cannot promise you a place in the course but I don't want you to get behind. Please do you best to keep up and I will let you know as soon as possible whether or not you will have a permanent spot in the course.
