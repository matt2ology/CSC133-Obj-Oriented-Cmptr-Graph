## Important Update :: All submissions must be complete!

All Sections

If you forget to upload a file with your submission, do not just upload only that file with a new submission. My grader is not going to go looking through all of your submissions to find all files. _**Every submission must contain all files for that submission every single time.**_ If you forget to upload a file then resubmit everything in a new submission. 

While I'm at it, note that your latest submission will always be graded with respect to the final submission. So you do not avoid the late penalty by submitting early and then updating your submission. If you submit anything in the late window then your assignment will earn a late penalty. Late penalties are automatically calculated and are always based on the latest submission. 

For the extra credit, there is no late window. That is, the latest submission that is in the system prior to 5pm this evening will be evaluated for extra credit. That submission must have both the source code and the < 1m video.
