## Quick Update :: Demo Video of Modified Simple Paint

All Sections

I've posted the demo video of the Modified Simple Paint program. I want to make it clear that your paint program must follow the same structure as the original program in the sense that you are simply using graphics context calls to draw shapes and the tool palette. I also want to make it clear that there are some aspects that are not demonstrated in the linked video but that are demonstrated in the original code. Make sure that you thoroughly test your program so that you know that it conforms to the standards delineated by the original source.  

**Office Hours**

As a reminder, office hours are on Wednesday. This means that you will have limited opportunities to ask me questions about this prior to the due date if you don't start the project this weekend.
