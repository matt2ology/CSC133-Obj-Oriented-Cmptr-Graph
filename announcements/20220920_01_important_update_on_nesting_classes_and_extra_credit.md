## Important Update :: On Nesting Classes and Extra Credit

All Sections

**Nesting Classes**

It seems that I should have been more clear regarding nesting classes. If you put all of the classes inside your main class, then many problems that you are supposed to be solving become trivial because everything is global. So, just to be clear, you can't do this. The only nesting that I intended for you to use was nesting the shapes in the tools. For example, you can put the LineShape class inside the LineShapeTool. However, you cannot nest any of the abstract classes and you cannot nest any class inside of the main class. 

I will update the project page either tonight or tomorrow to reflect these requirements. 

**Extra Credit**

As mentioned in class, if you didn't participate already in the extra credit then you may upload your Java source file and a narrated 1 minute video explaining where you are by tomorrow, Wed Sep 21st at 10pm and you will receive five points extra credit. If you have already uploaded, don't upload again. If you uploaded before the deadline, you will automatically receive the extra five points. There are no other conditions on the five points, just upload your work, and talk for a minute about where you are in  the project. Let me know what you are finding the most challenging. 

**Office Hours**

Don't forget that office hours are tomorrow from 5:30pm to 7:00pm
