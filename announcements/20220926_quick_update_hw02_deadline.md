Comcast has been down for a few hours and this has impacted my ability to respond to your messages in a timely fashion. Consequently, I have extended the non-late deadline for HW2 by two hours to give you enough time to ask any final questions. This does not change the late final deadline of 10PM, it only gives you a couple of additional hours to put the fine point on things without penalty. It also means that the max late penalty, if you turn it in by 10pm, is six percent.Â
