# Pong :: Two Ways - Homework 3

### CSC 133-03 Object-Oriented Computer Graphics Programming

## Your discussion

For this assignment it does not need a header or sub-headers. If you insist on
using a header you may use Discussion. If you would like to include a brief
introduction, that’s fine, give it a header of Introduction. For more complex
assignments this is required, for this assignment it’s fine to leave it off.

## Code

Your code in what amounts to appendices. For these each program should start
on a new page with the name of the file at the top of the page as the header.
The code should be formatted to not wrap. I find this to be much easier if you
limit your column width while coding. Later we will discuss this a bit more in
the context of clean code. If necessary you may shrink the font somewhat.
However, if you are below 9 points with 1/2" margins and your code still wraps,
then break the lines in your text editor.

Code in your writeup is black on a white background and is not screenshots.
I don’t want to see syntax highlighting and I definitely do not want to see
grainy screenshot fonts and weird artifacts along image edges. Copy and paste
the text into whatever you are using to format your writeup and format your
text with a monospace font in that environment.

### Content (You are limited to two pages max)

I want you to discuss the choices that you made in terms of your object
decomposition and why you made them. Justify your approach as best as you can.
Do not use filler words or hyperbole. Do use technical language. You may lean
on ideas in the Martin Robillard textbook if this helps.
