## **Q1)** \[5 points\] In about 250 words describe homogenous coordinates. What are they, why do we use them, and how are they different from non-homogeneous coordinates

In game development we mostly care about 3D, and also 2D, matrices are used
for transforming positions, directions, or other matrices. There are a lot of
other uses of matrices - as well as mathematical formalities, but in this context
we care about Vec4 and Matrix4 (x, y, z, w).
Homogenous coordinates are
